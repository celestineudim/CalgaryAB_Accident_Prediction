# CalgaryAB_Accident_Prediction
The goal of this project was to get my team familiar with data wrangling, prepare a machine-learning pipeline and subsequently a model to have an initial prediction by using real-world data set. Two data sets of accident information from Calgary Traffic Incidents and weather are given for this prediction.
